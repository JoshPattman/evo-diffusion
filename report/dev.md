# Development Rough Report
## Introduction
Introduction: You need not spend more than 1.5 pages describing the original paper.
- briefly describe the paper/experiment

## Experiment Setup
- What you evolved including:
    - How you represented individuals
    - What fitness function did you define
    - What kind of GA you used
    - Steady state/ generational?  Tournament selection/ fitness proportionate (roulette wheel)?
    - What kind of crossover (if any) you used.
    - All parameters (enough detail so a reader could re-implement the GA)

## Reimplemented Results
- 1 Page
- The reimplemented figures (side by side with the originals)
- Discussion of what the results show/don't show, what worked/didn't work, what you learned

## Extension
- 1 page
- What is your research question/hypothesis?
    - e.g., 'compare x with y' or 'add x and see what difference it makes compared to not(x)'.
- Describe methods / any advancements
- Support the value of asking that question (using literature)
- What do you expect to happen (what might happen)?
- Why do you think that?

## Extension Results
- 1.5 page

## Conclusion
- one page
- What do you conclude from that
- significance of the extension results
- critique/evaluation
